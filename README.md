# HTML Samples
This is a file to create samples of HTML work for a possible career in front or back end web development.

Feb 2019 - Starting to add examples of different CSS Code (just getting started with the basics). I will be working on a "digital notebook for myself to reference when working on projects. It will just be a local file but I will keep it up to date here. I will also update this read me file once a month to journal the overall changes to the file and what resources are added.
